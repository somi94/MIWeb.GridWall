# MIWeb.GridWall
A js package to group images/videos/containers inside a wrapping container.

The package is designed to be used within the Neos CMS, but the scripts and styles can be used on any webpage.
The files to use it without Neos can be found in Resources/Public directory.
The scripts are vanilla javascript, so no library required.
